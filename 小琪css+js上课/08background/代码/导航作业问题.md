### 1 理解了绝对定位是相对于 containning block去定位的

1. If the position property is **static** or **relative**, the containing block is formed by the edge of the *content box* of the nearest ancestor element that is **a block container** (such as an inline-block, block, or list-item element) or which **establishes a formatting context** (such as a table container, flex container, grid container, or the block container itself).
2. If the position property is **absolute**, the containing block is formed by the edge of the *padding box* of the nearest ancestor element that has a position value other than static (fixed, absolute, relative, or sticky).
3. If the position property is **fixed**, the containing block is established by the [viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/viewport) (in the case of continuous media) or the page area (in the case of paged media).
4. If the position property is **absolute** or **fixed**, the containing block may also be formed by the edge of the padding box of the nearest ancestor element that has the following:
   1. A transform or perspective value other than `none`
   2. A will-change value of transform or perspective
   3. A filter value other than none or a will-change value of filter (only works on Firefox).
